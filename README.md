# WordSearch
This is a simple Haskell program. The main function, simWord, requires two input values: a dictionary and a sentence. The purpose of the function is to identify words from the dictionary that appear in the sentence, allowing for a maximum of two characters' difference between the dictionary word and the sentence word. The output of the simWord function is an array in which each word appears only once, ensuring that duplicate words are not included.
